# Drift – Final CSS/SCSS Project

This is the final project for the CSS/SCSS class. The goal was to apply everything learned during the course to build a modern, visually polished landing page — using clean, maintainable SCSS.

## 🧑‍🏫 Project Background

It was agreed with the teacher that if this version looked better than the original reference design **and** showed good technical execution, the **whole class would get an extra point**.

You can check the original teacher’s design here:  
👉 [Teacher’s Landing Page](https://edit-fee.vercel.app/exercises/landing-page/index.html)

This version keeps the same **structure**, but replaces all **content** (text, images, theme) to demonstrate creative freedom and layout techniques.

## 🛠 What’s Inside

- ✅ Fully responsive layout
- ✅ Custom SCSS structure
- ✅ Use of variables, mixins, functions
- ✅ Flexbox and CSS Grid layouts
- ✅ Absolute and relative positioning
- ✅ Button hover effects and fluid typography
- ✅ Clean file organization

## 🧠 Notes

- All text content was generated by AI.
- Most images are from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/), except for the product shots, which were AI-generated.
- The entire page was built from scratch using only HTML and SCSS.
